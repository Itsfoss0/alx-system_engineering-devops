## About
SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote computers over an unsecured network, such as the internet. With SSH, you can establish a secure, encrypted connection between two devices, and remotely execute commands, transfer files, or tunnel other network traffic. SSH is widely used by system administrators, developers, and other users who need to remotely access and manage servers, routers, and other network devices. Lets get cracking.
